Generated: 2026-05-13

## Background

Three independent AI models (Claude, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.1 Pro) audited all 5,205 words' pronunciation. Cross-referencing their DANGER lists identified 13 high-risk heteronyms where TTS pronunciation may not match the intended word sense.

## Actions Taken

1. **Audio regenerated** — All 13 words/phrases re-synthesized with macOS Samantha voice (v2)
2. **audio-index.json updated** — Source changed to `macos-samantha-v2` with regeneration note
3. **pronunciationNote added** — 10 heteronym word entries now include pronunciation guidance in the word bank (visible to the app/learner)
4. **Free Dictionary API checked** — No audio available for any of these 13 words from the API

## Risk Assessment

- **Fully resolved (8/13):** appropriate, attribute, project, subordinate, deliberate, by contrast, in contrast, live up to
  - TTS default pronunciation matches the word bank sense, or phrase pronunciation is unambiguous
- **Residual risk (5/13):** contrast, transport, graduate, delegate, convict
  - TTS may read noun pronunciation when verb is intended. `pronunciationNote` field added to warn learners.
  - These 5 words could be further improved by sourcing human recordings (Forvo, Cambridge Dictionary) in a future pass.
